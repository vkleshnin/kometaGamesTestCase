**"Naughts and crosses"** test assignment to Kometa.Games gamedev studio for the position of Unity Developer.

Once the game starts, you can play. At the top, information about who moves is shown. On the bottom left there is a button "Reload", which starts the game again. And an "Exit" button.

When one of the players wins or draws, a window appears with the result of the game and a "New Game" button, clicking on which triggers the same logic as the "Reload" button.
